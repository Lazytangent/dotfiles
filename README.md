# Dotfiles

Just a repo to hold my dotfiles.

Currently holds things for MacOS and Linux machines.

## TODO:

* Organize Mac and Linux specific into their own folders
* Organize the Linux files by distro (and possibly use case)

## Fonts

If on MacOS, get nerd fonts with Homebrew.

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
```

```sh
brew install --cask font-<FONT NAME>nerd-font
```
